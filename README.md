This project develops an automated system for detecting Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC) using Convolutional Neural Networks. Trained on histopathological images, it classifies regions as IDC-positive or negative, aiding in early diagnosis and showcasing the potential of deep learning in healthcare.
