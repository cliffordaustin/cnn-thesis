## Project Overview
This project develops an automated system for detecting Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC) using Convolutional Neural Networks. Trained on histopathological images, it classifies regions as IDC-positive or negative, aiding in early diagnosis and showcasing the potential of deep learning in healthcare. You can explore the project in this [Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Zh_lCbnBv1LZxaj5ve2im5R__j63d8Jm?usp=sharing).

## Technologies Used
* TensorFlow
* Keras
* Matplotlib
* OpenCV
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Dataset
* The dataset used is the Breast Histopathology Images from Kaggle. It contains labeled histopathological images used to train and validate the model.

## How to Run
This project was developed and tested using Google Colab. Itâ€™s recommended to run the project in Colab for the best experience.

## Results
The model achieved an accuracy of over 97% after training for 100 epochs.
